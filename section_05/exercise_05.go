/*
  Building on the code from the previous example
  at the package level scope, using the “var” keyword, create a VARIABLE with the IDENTIFIER “y”. 
  The variable should be of the UNDERLYING TYPE of your custom TYPE “x”
  eg:
	type hotdog int
    var x hotdog
    var y int
  in func main
  this should already be done
  print out the value of the variable “x”
  print out the type of the variable “x”
  assign your own VALUE to the VARIABLE “x” using the “=” OPERATOR
  print out the value of the variable “x”
  now do this
  now use CONVERSION to convert the TYPE of the VALUE stored in “x” to the UNDERLYING TYPE
  then use the “=” operator to ASSIGN that value to “y”
  print out the value stored in “y”
  print out the type of “y”
  code: here’s the solution: https://play.golang.org/p/cj8RrYgBOD 
 */

package main

import "fmt"

type edward int

var t edward
var u int

func main() {
	fmt.Println(t)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", t)
	t = 2357
	fmt.Println(t)
	u = int(t)
	fmt.Println(u)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", u)
}
